      <p>Stefan was a man who could make anyone laugh with his debonair and positive attitude. Stefan was born on July 10, 1975 in the humble Iceland town of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnarfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur" target = "_blank">Hafnarfjorour</a>. He started working in the drama industry at the age of 19, studying at the Iceland Academy of the Arts.</n></p>
      <p>Stefan had disagreed with his academy's outlook on drama. Unsatisfied with the academy, an Icelandic gymnast called Magnus Scheving contacted him in 2004 to star in the iconic show that would place his name down in history - <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LazyTown" target = "_blank"><i>LazyTown</i></a>.</n>
      <p>Playing as the egregious villain Robbie Rotten, Stefan would continue to play this role for the entirety of LazyTown's runtime to encourage young kids to exercise and stay phyiscally fit. Particularly potent were his energizing performances of song and dance during the show's career.</p></n>
      <p>Stefan's acting work was not just limited to LazyTown. Stefan also did many works relating to theater in Iceland
      and across the world, acting in plays such as Little Shop of Horrors and The Grinch Musical as the titular Grinch.</p>
      <p>In film, Stefan made his debut in the Icelandic comedy show <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81ram%C3%B3taskaupi%C3%B0" target = "_blank">Aramotaskaup</a> in 1994, a show that satirizes the figures and news of the
      past year. He did voiceover work for Night at the Museum as well as Thor, and played the main character of the 2011 Icelandic
      film Polite People. He has also done voice work for the Viking Soldier in the game For Honor in 2017.</p>
      <p>In October 2016, Stefan Karl was sadly diagnosed with bile duct cancer, a rare and little known disease. LazyTown writer
      Mark Valenti set up a GoFundMe to pay for his living costs when he could no longer work due to his illness. It was then that
      the infamous <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_Number_One" target = "_blank">"We Are Number One"</a> meme, which consisted of videos playing with the original LazyTown song in different ways
      caused Stefan Karl's name to skyrocket in internet culture and into public consciousness.</p>
      <p>The popularity allowed thousands of people to donate funds to his GoFundMe, and Stefan created a video responding to the outpouring
      of support by the community in December 2016 in a video on his YouTube channel. On June 2017 a successful surgery had temporarily
      removed his metastases, and in August of 2017 he had gone under remission.</p>
      <p>Sadly, in March 2018 it had been reported that the disease had came back permanently, and that Stefan was going under chemotherapy
      to prolong life. In April he decided to stop chemotherapy and to live out the rest of his life with friends and family. On August 21, 2018 Stefan Karl Stefansson
      died at the age of 43.</p>
      <p>His wife, fellow actor Steinnun, and his 3 daughters and 1 son, had a tribute to him, spreading
      his ashes on a distant ocean as per his request. The internet also mourned his death, and in dedication to Stefan Karl, his manager
      Cheryl Edison announced the creation of the Stefan Karl Academy & Center for the Performing Arts in Switzerland in 2019.</p>
      <p>Stefan will be remembered forever for his positive attitude and his willingness to teach kids values and lessons. May he
      rest in peace.</p>
