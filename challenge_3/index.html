    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="yeet">
        <p>I am Reeve Lood. I was born here in Chicago in February 22, 2001. I have been living in Chicago my whole life.
        As a child, I mostly wanted to be an engineer. I have no idea why given that I am not very good at mechanical
        and physical skill, but I digress. As a kid I was always interested in video games due to their interesting
        structure and the level of aptitude that had to be placed in the design of them. This interest is what inspired
        me to become invested in computer science, and my life goal is to become involved in computer programming
        and insert myself into the game industry.</p>
        <p>My personal favorite video games of all time would probably be Team Fortress 2, Papers, Please, The Stanley Parable,
        and The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. My favorite movie of all time is The Truman Show. My favorite subjects in school
        are Computer Science and History. I personally like all periods of history and I have no real preference to study
        any particular one, as I am interested in how all cultures and societies have developed. I would probably describe
        my political side as center-left or just left but I personally think that "left" and "right" are arbitrary terms in the first place.</p>
